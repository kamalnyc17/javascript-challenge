#### The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we are going to create a table to display the collected data based on all of the eyewitness reports we could find to prove it! Since the dataset in quite large, we will also provide search functionality for the users to find information quickly and easily.

### We have divided this project into two parts, and they are in two different folder within this repo i.e. UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2

## Level 1: Update Table Automatically and Search by Date
#### This part of the project will load the entire dataset automatically as the user loads the website and format the data and adjust the alignment of the columns for better readability. Users will be able to search by date of incident.
## Level 2: Update Table Automatically and Search by multiple columns e.g. Date, City, State etc.
#### This part of the project will load the entire dataset automatically as the user loads the website and format the data and adjust the alignment of the columns for better readability. Users have much more flexibility to search by one or more of any of these columns: Date, City, State, Country, Shape.
